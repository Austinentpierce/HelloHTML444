    <h1>Monetary Hobby</h1>
    <p>
      Whenever im looking at a hobby I tend to look at one I can monetize. I
      first dabbled into stocks in 2018. The second I started I was hooked. The
      possibilities were endless with this skill once I fully learned it. The
      possibility of making money from anywhere in the world all while having
      the companies that you usually spend the money on are now making you
      money.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I started to be profitable after a year, not crazy profits but profit
      was profit in the start of it all. I started hearing and noticing that you
      could implement programming and have it directly help you become a better
      and more efficient trader. Also could develop other helpful tools, other
      traders could use.
    </p>
    <p>
      That had got me thinking what else could I do with the code? I know it
      would take a long time to become a full time stock trader so in the mean
      time I started looking at what to do for possibly a good job and developer
      really appealed to me. I like creating things that can solve peoples
      problems. Thats exactly why I started my stock trading business to help
      people also learn how to do what I was doing because I know every average
      person could use the skill of making a little bit of extra money per month
      and not have to leave their house. I wanted to create something bigger
      though. A new app or service with code to help peoples everyday lives a
      little bit easier. In this world nowadays that is much needed.
